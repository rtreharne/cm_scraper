Summative Assessment 1 Oral (40%) A 20 minute oral presentation, aided by prepared slides,  during which the student will outline the clinical presentation, diagnostics and surgical management of the case, critical reflection of the case management underpinned by the relevant evidence base; after which, there will an oral defence of this management plan for 10 minutes. Summative Assessment 2 Course work (60%) A 2000 word written assignment, which is a critical reflection of the management strategy, professional issues and patient outcomes, based upon, and/or stimulated by learning opportunities, from a complex case into which the trainee has had significant input in oral and maxillo-facial surgery. Formative (support for learning) A Multi-station Structured Clinical Examination (MSCE) will be based upon actual clinical cases.

LIFE724_FRONTIERS IN CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT,Coursework,25 %,Approved,"This module will be assessed via three assessments. Assessment 1 is a written report  where students are assessed for scientific  understanding and  critical analysis of cancer research. For example, the assessments (as shown in the table below) will include reports on pre-recorded seminars by experts in cancer research.  This assessment is 50% of the module. This is an anonymous assessment. Assessment 2 is a written assessment whereby the students are assessed on their ability to write a scientific as well as a lay abstract   on an emerging cancer research topic that follows a lecture theme. This assessment is 25% of the module. This is an anonymous assessment. Assessment 3 is a conference style oral presentation  on an emerging cancer research topic that follows a lecture theme. This assessment is 25% of the module. This is a non-anonymous assessment due to its nature. All assessments will be provided with feedback. Pass mark for all assessments is 50%. Reassessment strategy: Resit questions will have the same format as the original assessment but will focus on a different topic on the syllabus and will take place in the reassessment window and will be capped at 50%. Resits for the first assessment will be graded by data analysis and writing a small report. Standard UoL penalty applies for late submission of all assessments. Learning materials will be available to students via the University Virtual Learning environment. Curriculum 2021 and the Liverpool Hallmarks are at the centre of this module as evidenced by the cohesive research connected programme we have designed where all learning outcomes will be evaluated with authentic assessments that directly relate to activities performed by professional experts in the field (e.g. critical appraisal of scientific literature and seminars, in both oral and written formats). Research-connected teaching is embedded in all aspects of teaching as the module is taught by  scientists and clinicians, experts in the cancer research field. This module contributes to a Programme which is specifically designed to support students for future training in Health & Life Sciences as well as employability in this sector. The teaching approach is designed to promote students’ active learning by taking part in case-based learning, tutorials and workshops. “Students will be informed that, in exceptional circumstances (e.g. global pandemics), plans for assessment may be subject to change.

The module will be assessed via two assessments. Notes applying to both assessments: Data analysis will encourage students' engagement with the practical activities while helping staff to monitor their understanding of the topics. A key skill is the ability to critically analyse data and convey complex scientific ideas and discuss and defend these ideas.  The assessments will allow students to discuss relevant science to their degree, developing digital fluency and critical thinking skills in line with the Liverpool Curriculum Framework. Digitally fluent graduates are able to think critically and make balanced judgements about the information they find and use. Assessment 1 (40%) will be data analysis in the format of a 70 min online test. Students will be required to interpret bioinformatics analysis results presented to them, along with other questions aimed at assessing their comprehension of key principles in the field. Assessment 2 (60%) will be data analysis in the format of written assessment (1500 word equivalence) where students will be tasked with the production and analysis of data, and interpretation of the results - and/or review, evaluation, and discussion of published literature. Feedback will be provided to all assessments. Pass mark for all assessments is 50%. Standard UoL penalty applies for late submission of all assessments. Assessments are anonymous.

The chosen assessments are highly authentic and will embed important graduate attributes. Assessments include: Anatomical Teaching Poster (40%). To be done individually and on an anatomical structure covered within the module so far. LOs 2-6 will be covered by this assessment. Posters are an authentic method of education as they are used extensively at scientific conferences and can be used in other fields such as public health. This poster task also fills the hallmarks of digital fluency and although not presented by the students, producing the poster will still give the students confidence in communicating their work. Spotter Assessment (60%). This is a type of practical assessment commonly used in anatomy. Spotters are highly authentic and feature in medical Royal College entrance exams as a means of testing applied anatomical knowledge. Learner’s visit stations, at which they identify and explain anatomical features, as required. This may include a mix of prosected cadaveric specimens, models, medical imaging, etc. Questions will be layered to test increasing levels of complexity. Reassessment will use a similar format but the topic or data will differ. Mark will be capped at 40%. This will take place in the normal reassessment window. Standard UoL penalty applies for late submission. Students will be informed that, in exceptional circumstances (e.g. global pandemics), plans for assessment may be subject to change.

Authentic assessment, employing assessment for learning is supported by close alignment to the Intercollegiate FRCS in OMFS, and the highly contextual nature of the assessments, reflecting real world healthcare practice (case management) and scholarship.  The focus on evidence-based medicine ensures that the assessments are research connected. The summative assessments provide opportunities for extensive engagement with relevant literature to ensure students exit the programme with a robust theoretical understanding, and opportunities to enhance employability (e.g. through presentation at relevant clinical and scientific conferences and journals). Summative Assessment 1 Oral presentation (40%) A 20 minute oral presentation, aided by prepared slides,  during which the student will outline the clinical presentation, diagnostics and surgical management of the case, critical reflection of the case management underpinned by the relevant evidence base; after which, there will a discussion of this management plan for 10 minutes. Assessment 2 Course work (60%) A 2000 word written assignment, which is a critical reflection of the management strategy, ethical and professional dilemmas and patient outcomes, based upon, and/or stimulated by learning opportunities, from a complex case into which the trainee has had significant input in oral and maxillo-facial surgery. Formative (support for learning) A Multi-station Structured Clinical Examination (MSCE) will be based upon actual clinical cases. This will take the form of 4 x 20 minute stations, each manned by 2 examiners. There will be a 10 minute feedback session immediately following and general discussion during the final half day session.

The style is based on Trends in Ecology and Evolution Reviews. This cannot be anonymously marked, as each student has a unique title for their topic, agreed with one of the staff members. This agreement of unique titles is used because we want students to work on a topic they find interesting and potentially useful for their future career, but given our expectation that students will produce work of near-publishable or publishable standard, the subject has to be one in which the staff member is sufficiently well-versed that they can properly evaluate the Review.

When they address the question, they should use their knowledge and understanding of the module content, but they should also use relevant literature to add a different perspective and/or more detail. At the higher end of the marking scheme, markers will also be looking for an element of criticality and synthesis. We will also expect a well-founded conclusion. The first assessment (40%) is scheduled mid semester, and students will receive detailed feedback that they can then apply to the second assessment (60%) which is scheduled at the end of the semester. Prior to the first assessment students will have the opportunity to write a formative piece of the same nature, followed by class feedback.

LIFE364_BECOMING HUMAN,Coursework,40 %,Approved,"Assessment 1 will be a presentation of ~10 minutes in length centred upon a recent scientific research article relating to an element of the course. There will be 5 minutes of questions following the presentation. Students will have the choice of topic and paper and so will be able to follow their intellectual interests. Students will be prepared for and guided in preparation of the assessment in a series of formative workshops. The assessment thus exemplifies the hallmarks of authenticity and active learning, and is research-connected by design. The final assessment will consist of a choice of an open ended synoptic essay that bridges two of the three main themes of the module, and is modelled on a review article. This will allow students to focus explicitly on their intellectual interests as they have developed through the course. In this sense, the approach to assessment throughout the course will be developed very much in partnership with students, and will encourage and reward independent reading and active learning. The assessments reflect real-life and career-based scenarios (Authentic assessment hallmark of the Liverpool Curriculum Framework). Specifically, these assessments enhance digital fluency and presentation skills in our students. Both highly sought after by graduate employers.

(20%) This will include a skills audit, reflection on module tasks such as a cv and video interview and opportunity to reflect on academic feedback and the development of skills. The assessment strategy has been guided by the Liverpool Curriculum Framework attributes and hallmarks, particularly with respect to confidence, active learning, digital fluency, and authentic assessment. Individual and group feedback on authentic-assessments and self-reflections aim to support the development of study and employability skills, such as resilience and ability to recognise, and act upon, constructive feedback.  A key component of the assessment is therefore the production of a skills/self-reflection portfolio.  In addition to the portfolio, the three other assessments are designed to be authentic and will require students to combine all the skills they have developed over the course of the module. Reassessment will use the same format but the topic or data will differ. Mark will be capped at 40%. This will take place in the normal reassessment window.

Canvas tests will provide formative experience of summative assessments. There will be two summative assessment points; mid and end of Semester. Mid-Semester assessment will be by online, Canvas Quiz. End of Semester will be an invigilated exam. In both cases, the formative self-evaluation opportunities will give the students opportunities to develop confidence in their knowledge in readiness to apply it in summative assessment contexts. These assessments enhance professionalism, digital fluency, critical thinking and active learning, skills highly sought after by graduate employers. Additionally, we are creating confident graduates who will excel in their fields. These authentic assessments are problem-based and research-connected and the skills for completion are taught through active learning. The online tests requires students to lead their own inquiry of the content and build a critical knowledge base that will be applied to subsequent modules. Formative assessment and feedback opportunities allow students to develop confidence in their knowledge and understanding and this provides an inclusive approach for students to meet the learning outcomes. The assessments foster skills desirable in many sectors of employment and those of lifelong learning.

The second, worth 60%, will be an on-campus open-book exam carried out under exam conditions. Students will have access to materials such as code to assist during the exam. Reassessment will use the same format but the data will differ. This will take place in the normal reassessment window. Students will be informed that, in exceptional circumstances (e.g. global pandemics), plans for assessment may be subject to change. Contact will be made via the VLE and an e-mail will be sent to each of the students informing them of any changes that prove to be necessary.

This will comprise about twenty specimens to comment on or name, or some simple calculations based on work done during the course. Questions will be “multiple-choice”, plus one question answered orally about animal specimens that were curated (identified, labelled and preserved) by each student during the course. The resit will be a written exam. Assessment 2: Field Notebook to be completed during field course. This is a record of the student's field work, and is expected to allow a reader to understand what was done, why it was done, what the results were, and what they mean. Ideally a reader would be able to replicate the experiments based on the notebook. Length cannot be specified, as it depends on field results, but it is expected to require ~2 hours work each day beyond the work carried out writing it in the field. The resit will consist of a written piece of coursework. Assessment 3: Participation in field activities. Each student is given a mark from 1-5 (poor to excellent) by the team teaching them each day, based on the extent to which they got involved in practical field and laboratory work, and the intelligence and effort they put in to solving the problems they encounter in the field. This includes asking and answering questions, participation in class discussions, and demonstrating a professional attitude to fieldwork. They are assessed at all times when in the field, carrying out laboratory work, and during discussions of the work. Teaching teams evaluate students independently, but we find that there is a high degree of correlation in marks students are awarded across the four days. None of the Assessments can be anonymous as they require face to face interaction. Note that students cannot pass the module without attending the field course.

Topics for this module would include: ethical theories, concepts and principles. - E-portfolio (Case notes, podcast, blog: Students will create brief case notes/podcast/blogs around an ethical issue encountered in their practice which will inform their summative assessment. - Workshops: The workshops during the face-to-face component include exercises to review and practice ethical approaches to clinical practice. - A written formative assessment will encourage students to critically review a minimum of 2 ethical theories and discuss the implications for practice within their area of activity (about 1500 words). This will be a structured approach to finding and reviewing the literature to answer very specific ethical problems, using the best available evidence. The students are expected to have delivered a comprehensive summary of the 2 theories (at their choice), appraised systematically and expertly. B. The summative assessments for this module consist of the following components that combine critical appraisal (of ethical considerations, communication issues, evaluation of care needs) and critical reflection (on clinical examples): 1.Presentation 30%, (15 min.). The students will have to choose a relevant regulation/policy/law and analyse the underpinning ethical principles and how this impacts on ethically sound practice (e.g. mental capacity act, consent). They can reflect on their own professional experiences. The canvas online platform gives them an opportunity to create an e-portfolio of cases and skills observed, as part of authentic assessment. 2.Coursework 70%. Case study report. This is part of ‘authentic assessment’, mirroring a real-life report exercise. The students will select a case example from current practice and using moral theory, they have to critically review the decisions made with respect to the management of a particular case (3000 words). This will be a reflection on the role of ethical theories and principles that govern clinical interactions within the NHS (or other healthcare systems), or in the management of patients in clinical environments. This will focus not just on patient centred specific care, but the design and delivery of care pathways, governance and professional behaviours within multi-disciplinary interactions. These 2 linked assessments build on the previous experience providing an understanding of the complex nature of ethical decision-making. Re-assessment: Re-assessment will normally take place at the next re-assessment opportunity and within 12 months of the failed assessment where possible. Students will be offered a re-assessment opportunity in failed assessments in accordance with the University’s Code of Practice on Assessment, Appendix C.

This module has a strong assessment for learning ethos through the use of an in-module reflective portfolio which is reviewed by course tutors and receives actionable feedback (alongside direct instructor feedback during the surgical skills simulation course).  The focus on evidence-based medicine ensures that the assessments are research connected.. The summative assessments provide opportunities for extensive engagement with relevant literature to ensure students exit the module with a robust theoretical understanding, and opportunities to enhance employability (e.g. through presentation at relevant clinical and scientific conferences and journals and the benefits of participation in a highly specialist surgical skills simulation course) Summative Assessment 1: Oral (40%) A 20 minute oral presentation, aided by prepared slides,  during which the student will outline the clinical presentation, diagnostics and surgical management of the case, critical reflection of the case management underpinned by the relevant evidence base; after which, there will an oral defence of this management plan for 10 minutes. Summative Assessment 2: Course work (60%) A 2000 word written assignment, which is a critical reflection of the management strategy, professional issues and patient outcomes, based upon, and/or stimulated by learning opportunities, from a complex case into which the trainee has had significant input in oral and maxillo-facial surgery. Standard University assessment policies will apply, resit options as described in the Code of Practice on Assessment.

"BIOS211_PARASITES, PATHOGENS AND HOSTS",Coursework,40 %,Approved,"This module will be assessed by two pieces of coursework. The first assessment (worth 40% of the module) is a poster format (or equivalent) focussed on an example parasite or pathogen from the first half of the module, which the student will choose (which contributes to inclusivity) with staff supervision.   This can be  a traditional paper poster, or an electronic poster, or a static video installation, or a YouTube-style video, etc.  The teaching team will develop these options as this module progresses, and as technology and students’ interests develop. The second assessment (worth 60%) is in the format of a Briefing Note on a real-world relevant infection scenario, which will require students to understand and integrate different aspects of parasite and pathogen biology and apply this to a real-world setting, which is an authentic assessment. As mentioned above, both assessments are authentic: The poster or equivalent assessment requires students to lead their own enquiry to select, appraise and concisely communicate specialist subject knowledge in a digestible manner for different target demographics in a medium of their choice. This fosters skills desirable in many sectors of employment and those of lifelong learning and inclusivity. Written scientific assessment, in the form of a briefing note is highly authentic and requires students to understand and integrate different aspects of parasite and pathogen biology and apply this to a real-world infection scenario. Formative Feedback will be provided in the weekly workshop sessions and in this way for the assessed material. Pass mark for all assessments is 40%. Standard UoL penalty applies for late submission of all assessments. Assessments are anonymous. Resit strategy: Resit opportunity will be given to the assessments specified where a resit is available. The resit will have similar format and content as the original assessment, but with substantial revision required and will be submitted during the reassessment window and capped at 40% (pass mark).

Authentic assessment, employing assessment for learning is supported by close alignment to the Intercollegiate FRCS in OMFS, and the highly contextual nature of the assessments, reflecting real world healthcare practice (case management) and scholarship.  The focus on evidence-based medicine ensures that the assessments are research connected. The summative assessments provide opportunities for extensive engagement with relevant literature to ensure students exit the programme with a robust theoretical understanding, and opportunities to enhance employability (e.g. through presentation at relevant clinical and scientific conferences and journals). Summative Assessment 1 Oral (40%) A 20 minute oral presentation, aided by prepared slides,  during which the student will outline the clinical presentation, diagnostics and surgical management of the case, critical reflection of the case management underpinned by the relevant evidence base; after which, there will an oral defence of this management plan for 10 minutes. Assessment 2 Course work (60%) A 2000 word written assignment, which is a critical reflection of the management strategy, professional issues and patient outcomes, based upon, and/or stimulated by learning opportunities, from a complex case into which the trainee has had significant input in oral and maxillo-facial surgery. Formative (support for learning) A Multi-station Structured Clinical Examination (MSCE) will be based upon actual clinical cases. This will take the form of 4 x 20 minute stations, each manned by 2 examiners. There will be a 10 minute feedback session immediately following and general discussion during the final half day session.

All assessments are authentic and based on real world scenarios. The assessments involve scientific analysis focusing on a specific topic (including hypothesis testing, numerical and concept analysis, graphical interpretation, modelling, and meta-analysis). All assessments require each student to write a short scientific report aimed at developing life skills and a sound understanding of global ecological issues. Assessment 1: Group-working Scientific report (1500 words max) Assesses aspects of community ecology, including how and why variation within individuals can be associated with or alter community structure and functioning. The assignment requires students to develop scientific questions / hypotheses and propose statistical tests to investigate the relationship between intraspecific genetic variation and community level structure. The students’ proposed approach is revised through a discussion session in class, leading to a class-agreed consensus approach. Student groups then proceed to evaluate their hypotheses by statistical analysis of a provided dataset, and discuss and contextualise the results to reach conclusions. The student groups prepare a scientific report documenting the question/ hypothesis development phase, results of analyses and discussion of findings. Assessment 2: Individual Work - Scientific report (1000 words max) Assesses aspects of disease ecology such as recent issues associated with how infectious diseases spread through their host populations, and how an understanding of those ecological principles can facilitate the development of effective population-level disease control strategies. The assignment requires students to parameterise an epidemiological model from available data, use that model to explore a range of potential control strategies, and come to an evidence-based recommendation as to the most effective way to control the disease. The students produce a report describing the process, stating their recommendations and evaluating their confidence in their conclusions, given the limitations of the data available and assumptions of their model. The students also need to relate their findings and recommendations to previous scientific studies that have been carried out to manage real-world infections disease outbreaks (e.g., ebola, FMD, covid-19). Assessment 3: Individual Work - Scientific report (1000 words max) Assesses an understanding of macroecological models, and the ability to relate the demographic processes represented within a model to the patterns it predicts. The students are provided with a computer model which generates simulated community abundance samples.  They are required to explore the patterns of abundance and occupancy the model produces across spatial scales and parameter values.  The students produce a report where they present and interpret these patterns in terms of the biological processes that the model includes (and those it omits), and explain how these relate to predictions of other models such as Hubbell’s Neutral Theory There is a reassessment strategy. Assessment 1: Scientific report (1500 words max). The reassessment will involve the same basic task, but with a different study system and data. Since it will not be possible to recreate the group working component in a reassessment context, the assessment will be completed individually. Assessment 2: Scientific report (1000 words max).

Students will need to use subject knowledge and analyse / interpret their chosen evidence to draw hypotheses and conclusions on the drug class and its actions / physiological responses. Physiology and Pharmacology elements will both be covered in equal measure in this summative assessment. Students will work as a small allocated group to create a single digital poster (25% of module mark). Students will also each write an individual abstract, for their group's poster (15% of module mark). The posters will be audited using an online comparative judgement tool, by both staff and students independently. Marking will be performed by teams of staff on the module. 75% of the poster mark would come from the staff mark - rubric would be supplied. In addition to the peer assessment. 25% of the poster mark would come from the students' mark - rubric supplied to the students asking them to provide a mark out of 10 for the poster. Students also use online (‘Buddy check’) system which will be employed to allow group members to assess their own and their team members’ contribution during the production of the poster. Buddy Check produces a weighting factor based on students’ assessment of each other’s contribution on a 0-5 scale. The calculated weighting factors will be used to weight the group poster mark and produce an individual mark for each student to allow mark allocation and fairness based on the group engagement & team work.

All students will have  guidance and formative feedback given to them each week from their post graduate mentors (demonstrators)  if they come to the practical prepared to discuss their experimental outcomes. Assessment 2 - 10 minute Power point slide presentation given by each independent research project group (consists of at least 3 and no more than 4 students).  The students present to all of their class and are responsible for answering questions which last 5-7 minutes. The students participation in the group is monitored by staff, the post graduate mentors and the students themselves (students questionnaires). Any imbalance in group dynamics (over/under) is addressed early and moderated where possible.  Where this is not possible, an agreement between the students is reached by moderation with the coordinator between the group members on how to share the marks earned.  In most instances, preventative measures prevent group issues and most groups are happy to share marks. Assessment 3 - Proceeding document. A critical assessment of the experimental work done by the other groups during the practical.

The module includes informal weekly meetings and recorded monthly formal meetings with the supervisor, where the student records and discusses their achievements, while supervisor evaluates student’s performance and progress in similar to continuing assessment questionnaire way. Some of the meetings are dedicated to planning of the grant proposal; and supervisor’s comments on the draft. Supervisor assesses student progress and performance according to following criteria: Attendance/Effort/Allocation of time; Organisation and planning; Practical/theoretical/investigative skills; Scientific Understanding; Initiative and independence. A summative grant proposal in Semester one, encourages students to demonstrate understanding of the background and rationale of the project, whilst also providing clear aims and a project plan.  Written assessments are submitted and marked online for all students including detailed feedback from the supervisor on a draft copy prior to the final submission. For students who have chosen an online project all of these assignments can be completed in an online environment. The grant proposal will not be marked anonymously as it will need to be marked by the supervisor, an expert on the research topic and so the student will be easily identified. However, all proposals will be independently second marked by someone who hasn’t been involved in the delivery of the project. The reports reflect real-life scenarios (hallmarks of the Liverpool Curriculum Framework). The grant proposal is an outline proposal which would be common in requesting funding for a pilot study and would include a hypothesis, supporting evidence aimed to encourage critical analysis of the literature, and development of a feasible project idea and understanding. Supervisors will provide students feedback on the draft proposal typically within two weeks before final submission deadline. Students will be offered a re-assessment opportunity in failed assessments in accordance with the Code of Practice on Assessment Appendix C. Students resitting the grant proposal will be allowed to re-submit on their project. Students resitting the module will be required to develop a completely new project with a new supervisor. Resit opportunities are usually within 12 months of the failed assessment, and will be capped at the pass mark (50%) unless taken as a first sitting.

Data Analysis Task  - Poster Presentation Students will be required to examine and analyse a set of qualitative and quantitative data, then create and present a poster highlighting the findings from their analysis. To successfully complete these assessments, students will be required to engage with the Teaching and Learning activities outlined within the module.  For Assessment 1, students will need to familiarise themselves with critical approaches to review research papers (e.g. GREENHALGH, T. How to read a paper - 5th ed ISBN 9781118801116)  apply tools that support critical review (such as CASP https://casp-uk.net/) and required reporting guidelines (https://www.equator-network.org/).  For Assessment 2, students will need to engage with, practice and apply analysis techniques identified within the module learning opportunities provided. Students who fail the review and/or report will be assessed through a repeated attempt and improving the previously submitted assignment. Reviewing research evidence, and preparing research data for presentation and publication are important skills for current and future practice, and are part of authentic assessment. Students will be informed that, in exceptional circumstances (e.g. global pandemics), plans for assessment may be subject to change.  Contact will be made via the VLE and an e-mail will be sent to each of the students informing them of any changes that prove to be necessary.

Specifically, these assessments enhance digital fluency in our students, a skill highly sought after by graduate employers. Additionally, we are creating confident graduates who will excel in human anatomy. These authentic assessments are research-connected and the skills for completion are taught through active learning. Assessment 1 will be a spotter test (worth 30% final module mark). This assessment will be run in HARC (Human Anatomy Resource Centre) if COVID-19 restrictions allow this, and will consist of a number of ‘stations’, each comprising of either an anatomical specimen (bones, prosections, models) or x-rays / diagrams with associated questions. If it is not possible to hold the spotter in HARC then an electronic spotter, consisting of 20 powerpoint slides, will be used, as it was for the August 2020 resit spotter. Assessment 2 comprise an open-ended synoptic essay in the style of a short book chapter (worth 70% final module mark). All assessment marks are aggregated to a module mark. Both assessments have opportunity for resit in the appropriate summer resit period. They will be capped at 40% (unless in cases where ECs are approved). Spotter: Resit will be another spotter test in very similar format to the original, but with fewer specimens Essay: Resit will be another 2000 word essay under exact same conditions but the essay questions will be different. Students will be informed that, in exceptional circumstances (e.g. global pandemics), plans for assessment may be subject to change. Contact will be made via the VLE and an e-mail will be sent to each of the students informing them of any changes that prove to be necessary.

LIFE754_PROTEOMICS METABOLOMICS AND DATA ANALYSIS,Presentation,20 %,Approved,"The module will be assessed via three assessments. Assessment 1 (40% overall mark) This assessment will take the form of a scientific report (max 2000 words) on the theory and design of a proteomics experiment and the statistical analysis of a dataset.  Part of this assessment will be the appraisal and assessment of proteomics methodology using examples of the biological questions appropriate to each technique. This assessment directly links to the learning objectives LO1-LO3 specific to the proteomics technique and supports the development of skills S1 (problem solving), S2 (communication) and S3 (coding and statistical analysis). Assessment 2 (20% overall mark) In this assessment students will outline their strategy to perform the statistical data analysis of a metabolomics data set and the use of database resources to investigate the observed biological changes. Students will deliver a 10-minute individual presentation to outline their strategy and summarise key findings. This assessment directly links to the learning objectives LO1-LO3 specific to the metabolomics technique and supports the development of skills S1 (problem solving), S2 (communication) and S3 (statistical analysis). Assessment 3 (40% overall mark) In this assessment students will produce a written report (max 1000 words) in a format suitable for submission in a research publication to summarise considerations in the design of a metabolomics experiment and describe the statistical data analysis performed on a metabolomics dataset. Part of this assessment will be the appraisal and comparison of proteomics and metabolomics approaches to investigate biological systems. This assessment directly links to the learning objectives LO1-LO3 specific to the metabolomics technique and supports the development of skills S1 (problem solving), S2 (communication) and S3 (statistical analysis). Reassessment strategy: Resit questions will have the same format as the original assessment but will focus on a different topic on the syllabus and will take place in the reassessment window and will be capped at 50%. Standard UoL penalty applies for late submission. Feedback will be provided to all assessments. Pass mark for all assessments is 50%. All assessments are anonymous. Learning materials will be available to students via the University Virtual Learning environment. Liverpool Curriculum Framework addressed: - Research-connected teaching. The assessment strategy will assess meaningful and integrated application of relevant academic knowledge, skills and synthesis from the course materials and associated workshops. - Authentic Assessment. The scientific report-based questions, will allow students to assimilate, assess and process information in a manner similar to those that will be expected as a citizen or post-graduate level professional. - Confidence. Students will develop skills that are routinely applied in the workplace environment including the analysis and evaluation of research data and effective communication of their work. Developing workplace relevant skills will build confidence in students to demonstrate their employability and prepare students for the workplace environment. “Students will be informed that, in exceptional circumstances (e.g. global pandemics), plans for assessment may be subject to change. Contact will be made via the VLE and an e-mail will be sent to each of the students informing them of any changes that prove to be necessary.

The module is assessed by XJTLU via submission of a preliminary literature survey report and project plan, an oral presentation to peers and academic members, submission of dissertation and continual assessment (See detailed assessment plan given under 'Assessments' tab). Written assessments are submitted and marked online for all students including a draft formative opportunity. The continual assessment element will assess the student’s conduct and performance throughout the project and will be conducted by the Liverpool Supervisor. The preliminary project report will not be marked anonymously as it will need to be marked by the UoL supervisor, an expert on the research topic and so the student will be easily identified. The reports reflect real-life scenarios (Authentic assessment hallmark, Liverpool Curriculum Framework). The preliminary report will be a literature survey of the research area suggested, critical analysis of the literature,  and would include a hypothesis. The preliminary report will also support the development of communication skills, data analysis and discussion of findings in relation to the field of research. The dissertation will be marked by 2 markers (one from UoL [supervisor] and the other from XJTLU). Oral presentations will be carried out in a hybrid format and will be marked by 3-4 markers. The oral presentation reflects real-life situations (authentic assessment hallmark, Liverpool Curriculum Framework) for a research scientist and will be assessed by the panel on scientific correctness, presentation skills, time management and ability to answer questions. The assessments aim to support scientific and lay communication skills development, reflection on the project and self-confidence. In order to minimise the impact of air travel on climate change many conferences, poster and oral presentations are now taking place online or in a hybrid model e.g. with invited international attendees presenting via live video communication links. We will ensure that a hybrid model is possible with the option to change to completely online when necessary. Re-sits are only available for the dissertation (resubmission) and not for the other components (see details below). The break-down of the summative coursework assessments are as follows: 1)Literature Survey and project plan (15% final mark), testing LO’s 1, 2, and 3 with no resit. 2)Log Book (5% final mark), testing LO 4, with no resit. 3)Oral Presentation (15% final mark), testing LO’s 1, 2, and 5 with no resit. 4)Dissertation (65% final mark), testing LO’s 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 with a resit opportunity. Marks for components where no resit opportunities are offered will be carried forward, whether or not they are passed or failed, and will be calculated, with the same weighting, in the final module mark.

This assessment, in Semester 1, will allow students to discuss relevant science to their degree, developing communication and critical thinking skills in line with Liverpool Curriculum Framework (LCF) Hallmarks. - Scientific report (60%) : Scientific report on work performed in the module: This assessment will comprise an analysis of the practical work performed in the module, including presenting the results in tables and figures appropriate to a scientific paper and discussing the results in a biological context. The assessment strategy will assess meaningful and integrated application of bioinformatics tools in research, digital fluency, and active learning. The report will allow students to demonstrate a systematic knowledge and critical understanding of the essential concepts in their chosen field of study, mirroring a professional undertaking (LCF – Authentic assessment). - Scientific poster (20%). The poster will demonstrate usage of bioinformatics techniques learnt in the module e.g., figure plotting in R or python, with results generated from preliminary analysis of data provided by project supervisors, also incorporating a future project planning element. Mirroring a professional undertaking (LCF – Authentic assessment), students can present their posters in a poster symposium format, where they are actively graded on all-round content, communication, and ability to respond to scientific inquiry. All assessments will be evaluated according to ‘I-C-E’ principles: · “I” for ideas e.g., following the assessment guidelines and providing explanations based on provided background. · “C” for connections e.g., describing cause-and-effect relationships and showing how this connects to the bigger picture. · “E” for extensions e.g., making extended connections in novel and creative ways to other areas that have not been covered previously. The pass mark for all assessments is 50%. Standard UoL penalty applies for late submission of all assessments. For each assessment, feedback will be provided and actively discussed with each student according to achieving learning outcome goals, closing gaps in current performance and personal aims, and identifying areas to enhance performance and learning. Resit strategy: resit opportunity will be given to the assessment and will have the same format and content as the original assessment, but with substantial revision required and will be submitted during the reassessment window and capped at 50% (pass mark). Apart from the presentation, the assessments are anonymous. Learning materials will be available to students via the University Virtual Learning environment. Students will be informed that, in exceptional circumstances (e.g. global pandemics), plans for assessment may be subject to change. Contact will be made via the VLE and an e-mail will be sent to each of the students informing them of any changes that prove to be necessary. The Health and Life Sciences FAQSC will be informed in advance of any such changes, so that approval can be given."
